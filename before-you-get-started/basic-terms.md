# Important terms

## 1. Gift product

Gift product is the free/discounted product your customer will receive when their order satisfies the condition of your offer. 

#### How it is created

When you select a product to be the gift of your offer, the app will clone a variant from your original product. That variant will be sent to your customer once they meet the condition of your offer

**Inventory management of gift product:**

By default, all gift products are set as “No Track quantity” but you can enable a feature to track them by synchronizing it with the inventory of the original product. Moreover, we have a feature called “DraftOrder API”, which won’t clone variants but work as customers buy original products with discounts. 

## 2. Offer on Cart

Offer on Cart rewards gifts to customers if they satisfy a certain value in their cart. For example: 

* Purchase over $200 get a Stylus Pen 
* Purchase over $300 get a Headphone 
* Purchase over $500 get a Wireless Headphone 

## 3. Offer on Catalog

Offer on Cart rewards gifts to customers if they satisfy a certain value in their cart. For example: 

* BOGO - Buy One Get One
* Buy X get Y

## 4. Multi offers

* Offer 1: Buy X get A
* Offer 2: Buy X+Y get B \(not included/included A\)
