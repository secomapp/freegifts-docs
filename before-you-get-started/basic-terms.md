# Important terms

## 1. Gift product

This is the product \(free or discounted\) your customer will receive when their order satisfies the condition of your offer rules. 

#### How to create it?

When you set up your offer rules and select the products to be gifts for the offers, the app will help clone gift variants/products for you. Most of the gift products will bear similar properties as the original ones; however, some like SKU, barcode can change the format inside the _Settings_ page of our Free Gifts app.

#### **Inventory management for gift product:**

As default, all cloned gift products will be set up as "No Track quantity" but you can enable a feature to synchronize the inventory between gift products and original items. Or you can also use the feature to create offers by "Draft-order API" and everything will work the same as customers buy original products with discounts.

## 2. Cart offer rule

This kind of offer allows you to reward gifts to customers if they purchase an order that satisfies certain quantity or value. For example, for a mobile & accessory store, there are such offers to create:

* Buy more than $200 and less than $300 to get a free _Stylus Pen_
* Buy more than $300 and less than $400 to get a free _Headphone_
* Buy more than $500 to get a free _True Wireless Headphone. etc._

## 3. Catalog offer rule

This offer type allows you to reward gifts to customers when they buy specific products. For example:

* BOGO: Buy a _Google Pixel 4 XL_ phone to get a free _Samsung EB-P1100 10.000 Mah_
* Buy any 2 of _iPhone 11 cases_ or _Samsung galaxy Note 10 case_ to get a free item in _Full Cover Camera Lens Screen Protector_  category, etc.

## 4. Multi offers working together

With our Free Gifts app, you can schedule the date and time for offer to activate. Plus, you can make many offers work together. For example:

* Offer 1: Buy _**A**_ to get free _**Z**_; Offer 2: buy _**A & B**_ to get free _**Y**_  \(not include _**Z**_\)
* Offer 1: Buy more than $500 to get free _**Z**_ and skip other offers. Offer 2: buy _**A**_ to get discount 30% of _**Z**_. Offer 3: buy 2 _**A**_ to get discount 60% of _**Z**_ or to get free _**X**_ \(skip offer 2\). etc.
