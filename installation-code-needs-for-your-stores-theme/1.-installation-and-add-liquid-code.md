# 1. Liquid code to hide cloned gift variants

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**We highly recommend you let us complete the code installation for you** because it will help to avoid hassle of doing it yourself \(And It's_  _absolutely **FREE** for you\)._

_If you need us, just take ONE MINUTE to create an account with permission \(**app, theme and product**\) for our team's email: **support@secomapp.com**_

_For how to create a staff account, please refer to_ [_this post_](http://docs.shopify.com/manual/settings/account/staff-members) _and_ [_this short video_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCROFM4-SFU&list=PLfZvxg1NZTJicOZfVUfjZ0e_4iULxSn1g%29)_._
{% endhint %}

You can base on the general instruction to have it inserted yourself. But specific themes and situations might need further work.

Once an offer is created and applied to your shop, variants of the gift product will be cloned inside this product item itself. Liquid code needs to be added to hide the cloned gift variants from the gift product. 

As default, the gift variants will be named the same as the original product \(which you have set it as the gift\) but also with the ending "\(100% off\)" noted for a free gift, or in a discounted value, for example, "\(70% off\)".



![Cloned gift products ](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

* Start by Opening the **product.liquid** file or the file that contains the code showing the product page like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/edit-theme.gif)

* Then find the code line, which is inside the for-loop as follows:

```elixir
<div class="select-wrappers{% if hide_default_title %} hidden{% endif %}">
<select id="product-select" name="id" class="hidden">
{% for variant in product.variants %}

<option {% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected{% endif %} value="{{ variant.id }}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>

{% endfor %}
</select>
</div>
```

* And add the following code before and behind of the **&lt;option&gt;** tag as below \(line 5 and line 7\):

```elixir
<div class="select-wrappers{% if hide_default_title %} hidden{% endif %}">
<select id="product-select" name="id" class="hidden">
{% for variant in product.variants %}

{%unless variant.metafields.secomapp.freegifts %}
<option {% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected{% endif %} value="{{ variant.id }}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>
{%endunless%}

{% endfor %}
</select>
</div>
```

That's it! After having the code installed properly on your theme, you can start setting up gift offers as you wish!
