Once an offer is created and applied to your shop, variants of the gift product will be cloned inside this product item itself. Liquid code needs to be added to hide the cloned gift variants from the gift product. 

As default, the gift variants will be named the same as the original product \(which you have set it as the gift\) but also with the ending "\(100% off\)" noted for a free gift, or in a discounted value, for example, "\(70% off\)".

* Open the product.liquid file or exactly file contain code for showing product page

![](../.gitbook/assets/edit-theme.gif)

* Please find the code line, which is inside the for-loop as follows:

```elixir
<div class="select-wrappers{% if hide_default_title %} hidden{% endif %}">
<select id="product-select" name="id" class="hidden">
{% for variant in product.variants %}

<option {% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected{% endif %} value="{{ variant.id }}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>

{% endfor %}
</select>
</div>
```

* Then add the code to before and end of the option tag as below:

```elixir
<div class="select-wrappers{% if hide_default_title %} hidden{% endif %}">
<select id="product-select" name="id" class="hidden">
{% for variant in product.variants %}

{%unless variant.metafields.secomapp.freegifts %}
<option {% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected{% endif %} value="{{ variant.id }}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>
{%endunless%}

{% endfor %}
</select>
</div>
```
