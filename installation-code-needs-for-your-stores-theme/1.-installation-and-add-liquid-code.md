After offer is created and applied, gift products will be cloned inside same product selected as gift. So we need to implement code for hide gifts from those product. As default gift's name will has same name as original product and surfix "\(100% off\)" or by the value dicounted value "\(70% off\)"

![Cloned gift products ](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

* Open the product.liquid file or exactly file contain code for showing product page

![](../.gitbook/assets/edit-theme.gif)

* Please find the code line, which is inside the for-loop as follows:

```text
<div class="select-wrappers{% if hide_default_title %} hidden{% endif %}">
<select id="product-select" name="id" class="hidden">
{% for variant in product.variants %}

<option {% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected{% endif %} value="{{ variant.id }}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>

{% endfor %}
</select>
</div>
```

* Then add the code to before and end of the option tag as below:

```text
<div class="select-wrappers{% if hide_default_title %} hidden{% endif %}">
<select id="product-select" name="id" class="hidden">
{% for variant in product.variants %}

{%unless variant.metafields.secomapp.freegifts %}
<option {% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected{% endif %} value="{{ variant.id }}">{{ variant.title }} - {{ variant.price | money }}</option>
{%endunless%}

{% endfor %}
</select>
</div>
```
