This is an option in the condition section of Gift on cart rule. The option is only used in case you use multi rules.

### **Example 1**:

* Rule1: Buy 2 product get free gift A. At this rule you check the option "Use gift\(s\) in condition of other gift on cart rules"
* Rule2: Buy 3 product get free gift B.

Then if an customer buy 2 product, he will get product A is free. SO now in the cart there are 3 product \(include A\) so the rule2 is satisfied, then customer also get free gift: B.

### Example 2:

* Rule1: Buy more than $100 get a discount 20% of headphone \($50\)
* Rule 2: Buy more than $150 get a free iphone case \(with this feature enabled\)

So if customer buy more than $110 and he/she aceppted buy headphone with 20% discount. So total cart value is more than $150 and he/she get the free iphone case too.
