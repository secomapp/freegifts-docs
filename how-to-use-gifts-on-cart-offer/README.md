# How to create Offer on Cart

Offer on Cart means to reward your customer when their orders meet specific conditions.   
For example: 

* Purchase over $200 get a pen 

## **Here are the step-by-step instructions to create a new Offer on Cart:**

### General section

1. **Name**: Set the Name of your offer 
2. **Description**: Set the Description of your offer
3. **Start Date and End Date**: Set the duration of your offer \(date, hour\) 
4. **Promotion message**: Set the message to appear on the customers’ cart page. 

   For example: Customers will see your “Purchase over $500 to get a free gift” message so they are motivated to reach that condition to get a free gift. 

5. **Maximum number of gifts**: Set the number of gifts that customers are allowed to select when you offer them choices among several gifts. 

   Note: When you set this field to 0, all your free gifts will be automatically added to your customers’ cart 

6. **Discount percentage of Gift Items**: Set the discount percentage of your gift items. By default, the percentage is 100%, which means a free gift. 
7. **Priority**: Set the priority in case you run multiple offers. The smaller number means the greater priority.
8. **Stop lower priority rule**: The offers are processed by priority so if you enable this feature, lower priority won’t be processed. 

### **Condition section: Set the condition of your offer**

You can set up the condition of your offer based on 2 criteria: Total Cart’s value and Total Cart’s quantity. You can also narrow your offer by Products or Customers’ order history

Narrow by Products means: Customers have to buy these products and meet the offer’s condition to receive the gifts.
