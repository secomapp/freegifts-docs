# What is the "Use gift\(s\) in condition of other gift on Cart offer" feature?

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

This feature is used when there are multiple offers at the same time. It will decide whether the gift of one offer can be qualified for other offers or not. 

For example:   
You are having 2 offers: 

1. Purchase $100 and get a chance to buy AirPod with 50$
2. Purchase $150 and get a free phone case. 

If you enable the “Use gift\(s\) in condition of other gift on Cart offer” in the \(2\) offer, the $50 AirPods is also qualified, then customers will receive both the chance to buy a $50 AirPod and a free phone case.
