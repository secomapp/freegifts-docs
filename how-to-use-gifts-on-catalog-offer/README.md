2. Description: Set the Description of your offer
3. Start Date and End Date: Set the duration of your offer \(date, hour\) 
4. Promotion message: Set the message to appear on the customers’ cart page. 

   For example: Customers will see your “Purchase over $500 to get a free gift” message so they are motivated to reach that condition to get a free gift. 

5. Maximum number of gifts: Set the number of gifts that customers are allowed to select when you offer them choices among several gifts. 

   Note: When you set this field to 0, all your free gifts will be automatically added to your customers’ cart 

6. Discount percentage of Gift Items: Set the discount percentage of your gift items. By default, the percentage is 100%, which means a free gift. 
7. Priority: Set the priority in case you run multiple offers. The smaller number means the greater priority.
8. Stop lower priority rule: The offers are processed by priority so if you enable this feature, lower priority won’t be processed.
