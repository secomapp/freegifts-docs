# Disable multiple gift feature for Catalog offer

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2829%29.png)

Normally, when you set up Buy X get Y offer, you have to insert the number of Y in the “Minimum number of products customer should buy”. 

For example, buy 2X get 1Y, you have to insert 1 in that field. So that when customers buy 2X get 1Y, 4X get 2Y, 6X get 3Y, … 

However, if you do not want customers to receive multiple gifts but only 1Y even if they buy several X, you can turn on the “Disable multiple gifts feature”.
