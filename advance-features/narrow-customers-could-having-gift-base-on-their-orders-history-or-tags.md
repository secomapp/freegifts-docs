# Narrow by Customers' orders history

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

With our Free Gifts app, you can easily limit customers who get the gifts by their orders history or customer’s tags.   
For example, you can limit the offer to only customers who had purchased at least 100$ in the last 15 days. 

You can set the conditions of their orders history based on Min/Max of their total spent, Min/Max of their Total number orders, Min/Max of their Total last order. 

You can also limit this offer based on Customer’s tags and even limit them to only receive one \(for next 20 orders\)
