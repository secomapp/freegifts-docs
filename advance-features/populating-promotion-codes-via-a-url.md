# Populating Promotion Codes via a URL

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2835%29.png)

This feature helps you to create a URL of the offer that only customers who get the link will receive the offer. Insert the appropriate code for your customer, for example: BLACK-FRIDAY-EMAIL

Then our app will generate for you a URL as: https://\[your\_store\_domain.com\]?freegifts\_code=BLACK-FRIDAY-EMAIL

Tips:   
\#1. You can use this feature together with Shorten URL tool as goo.gl, tinyurl.com, etc before sending it to your customers.   
\#2. You can also use this feature to test your offer without affecting your live store.   
For example, insert TEST in that field, then you can use the link: https://\[your\_store\_domain.com\]?freegifts\_code=TEST to test your offer without affecting your live store.
