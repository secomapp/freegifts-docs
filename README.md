**Free Gifts app covers most of the hottest gifts and discounts offers.**

**BOGO**

Buy One – Get One: Very easy but effective promotion rule: When customers buy one certain item, they will be given another kind of product as a gift.

**Offers on Certain products \(Offers on Catalog rule\)**

Customers gain free gifts or any kind of discounts only when they purchase particular products. Example rules are:

* Buy X get Y free
* Buy X get 40% off of Y
* Buy X get many free gifts \( Y,Z...free\)
* Buy any product from a category A get gift\(s\)
* Buy any product from a vendor A get gift\(s\)
* And Many More...

**Offers on cart \(Offers on Cart rule\)**

Customers receive gifts or any kind of discounts based on their shopping cart. Conditions can be total product quantity, total order value, etc.

* Purchase over 500 USD get X free
* Purchase over 500 USD get 40% off of X
* Purchase over 500 USD get many free gifts \(X, Y... free\)
* Purchase 3 items get X free
* Purchase 3 items get 40% off of X
* Purchase 3 items get many free gifts \(X, Y... free\)
* Purchase 3 items get one gift \(or multi gifts\) in a category A

**Multi offers on cart rule**

You can create multi rules \(multi offers\). For Example: Purchase from 500 USD to 1000 USD get a pen free and purchase from 1000 USD to 2000 USD get a book free.

**Upsell and cross-sell**

You have a chance to draw customer attention to other products on your store. Customers who are buying one product are likely to be persuaded to get other products which are complementary or even of higher value if those ones are displayed as free or discounted items.

**Motivate customers by Promotion Message and Banner**

Promotion Message and Banner is displayed on cart page. It allows shop owners to advertise and help customers know exactly how close they are to receive a promotion! This is like a smart strategy to urge them to buy more or it is called up-sell but it doesn’t make customers feel annoyed.
