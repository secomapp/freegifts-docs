### 2. The banner promotion will only show when the cart has not reached the condition.

If the cart reaches the condition and customers get gifts, it wonâ€™t show anymore. 

For example, your offer is Buy 3 products get a free gift, you can design a banner to advertise this message. When customers buy less than 3 products, the banner will show to motivate them to buy more.
